## Web App for Automated ML Model Training
This project focuses on developing a no-code web application that enables users to automate machine learning model training through a simple interface. By uploading CSV datasets, users can preprocess data, select different scalers, and choose from a wide range of machine learning algorithms for model training and evaluation, all without writing code. This streamlines the machine learning workflow, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## About
Web App for Automated ML Model Training is a project designed to automate the machine learning workflow by providing a user-friendly, no-code interface for model training. The application allows users to upload datasets, preprocess data, and select from a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, and more. Through the use of advanced scaling and preprocessing techniques, the app ensures that data is ready for model training. Users can easily train and evaluate models, improving efficiency and reducing the technical barriers typically associated with machine learning tasks. This tool empowers both beginners and professionals to streamline their ML experiments and achieve accurate results without coding.

## System Architecture
<!--Embed the system architecture diagram as shown below-->

The architecture consists of a Streamlit-based frontend where users upload CSV files and configure model training. The backend handles data preprocessing, including scaling, encoding, and splitting. Selected models, from Scikit-learn or advanced classifiers like XGBoost, are trained in the model training layer. Trained models are saved as pickle files, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy are displayed to the user.
